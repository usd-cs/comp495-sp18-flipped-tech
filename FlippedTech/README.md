To run the program, you must have the repository saved onto your computer. Once there, open up your terminal and navigate to where you saved this repository. Go into the "FlippedTech" folder and run the following command "node app.js". After running this command, a line stating "server has started" will be displayed. This means that it is successfully running. You can view the program by then going into your internet browswer of choice and entering the url "http://localhost:3000".

To check out the other pages, add "/<page name>" to the end of the url. The supported url's are listed in the app.js file

To exit, you can close the page on your browser and then go back to your terminal and enter "Control (button) c". This will stop the server.

If you would like to make changes and see it on the server, simply stop the server as stated above, and then start it back up as instructed in the first paragraph.
