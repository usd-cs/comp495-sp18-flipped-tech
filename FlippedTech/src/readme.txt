This folder includes the ejs files that are then being rendered into html code and outputted onto your internet browser. We are using ejs files because it allows us to write html files that can dynamically be changed because ejs files support embedded javascript. This allows us to pass variables to different ejs files. This functionality allows us to create templates and fill them with the relevant information.
